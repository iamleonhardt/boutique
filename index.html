      <h2>Welcome to MBoutique!</h2>
            <p>
                We are a home-based baking business that specializes in the making of French macarons, a gluten-free pastry item made from ground almonds. Ous business began at the West Reading Farmers Market in 2011. Last year(2013) marked our third and final season of participating at the market. MBoutique was stablished to pay homage to the delicate french confectionery, the macaron. Our shop has been recognized as the connoisseurs of this delicious French pastry because of the wonderful variety of flavors from our great master chefs.

            <h2>We Love Macarons!</h2>
            <p>
                Renowned macarons, French delights of the moment can be met in a variety of flavors and colors and are brilliant precisely because of their simplicity - a crispy coating but delicate in a loose blanket jam, chocolate butter cream is spread inviting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Macarons combine perfectly with champagne or white wine, tea or hot chocolate, fresh juices and natural fruit flavored coffee and grantee that these little delights soon become friends and you can not break.
